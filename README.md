# School of AI: Universal Social Media Graphic Generator
Social Media Image Templates for the School of AI Global Community

## Automatically Generate SVG files for your City
Install requirements using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once your requirements are installed simply run:
`python customizesvg.py "Your City Name"`

Open the path `Social_Media_Assets/generated_templates' to review your customized images

## Social Media Assets Folder
I've just created SVG (Inkscape) templates (Social_Media_Assets) that can be customized with your city name. Just open the file, update your name, and if you want add an image to the background (for example a panorama of your city) and export it and upload it to your social media profile.
