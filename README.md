## Automatically Generate SVG files for your City
Install requirements using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once your requirements are installed simply run:
`python customizesvg.py "Your City Name"`

Open the path `Social_Media_Assets/generated_templates' to review your customized images

## Social Media Assets Folder
I've just created SVG (Inkscape) templates (Social_Media_Assets) that can be customized with your city name. Just open the file, update your name, and if you want add an image to the background (for example a panorama of your city) and export it and upload it to your social media profile.

## Social Media Assets Folder!
I've just created SVG (Inkscape) templates (Social_Media_Assets) that can be customized with your city name. Just open the file, update your name, and if you want add an image to the background (for example a panorama of your city) and export it and upload it to your social media profile.

### Templates Include the following:
  * Facebook Fan Page Header Image (315px x 851px)
  * Facebook Fan Page Square Image (160px x 160px)
  * Facebook Group Cover Photo (1640px x 856px)
  * Twitter Profile Header (1500px x 500px)
  * Twitter Profile Picture (400px x 400px)
  * Linkedin Post Header Image (1200px x 644px)

## Next Steps
Flesh-out the code in this repo so that all that a dean has to do is place a single image into the `source_images` folder, run the script, enter their *city name* and hit generate. That will create all the required graphics in the dimensions listed below:

## Feature Development
1. Place a large resolution image in a folder called 'source_images'
2. Run the script
3. The folder 'generated_images' is populated with the following images:
